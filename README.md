# SQL_Data-Analysis_Mobile_Company
This SQL project is a Case Study that use Movie Voting Popularity System (MVPS) database, designed to store comprehensive details about movies,
actors, consumer ratings, and other relevant aspects of managing movie-related information to answer several business questions to satisfy the needs of movie enthusiasts and industry
professionals alike.


All the datasets and tables are created by RMIT University for teaching and testing purposes, therefore, there are some funtions initially created. 

I used RMIT's online SQL server to conduct the analysis.
